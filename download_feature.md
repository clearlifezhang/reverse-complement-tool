# Reverse Complement Tool - Download Feature Documentation

## Introduction

The Reverse Complement Tool has been updated to include a new "Download Result" feature. This feature allows users to download the reverse complement of a DNA sequence, which is displayed on the tool, as a text file. This can be particularly helpful for users who want to archive or share the reverse complement result.

## Features

* Button Availability: The "Download Result" button is initially disabled and only becomes active when a valid DNA sequence reverse complement is generated.
* File Format: The downloaded file is a plain text file (.txt).
* Error Handling: If the entered sequence contains invalid characters, the download button will become inactive (grayed out), and the result will not be downloadable.

## User Guide

* Enter the DNA Sequence: Input your DNA sequence into the text box.
* Generate the Reverse Complement: Click on the "Click me" button to generate the reverse complement.
* Download the Result: If the sequence is valid, the "Download Result" button will become active. Click on it to download the reverse complement as a text file.
